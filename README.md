In this challenge, Heroes of Pymoli, I was assigned with generating a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful information. My first step was to find the total number of players playing the game. Then I broke down the purchasing data into more meaningful numbers. Through this, I discovered that there were 780 purchases total, resulting in a revenue of $2,379.77. Next, I went through the data and discovered the percentage of male, female, and other/non-disclosed players. In total, there were 84.03% males, 14.06% females and 1.91% other/non-disclosed players. In addition, I analyzed the purchasing data by gender and found that males made the most purchases with 652, spending a total of $1,967.64. After this, I broke down the different ages into groups and analyzed the data even futher. The majority of players were in the age range 20-24, making up 44.79% of the total players. The age range with the least amount of players was the 40+ with only 2.08%. This also directly correlated with the amount of purchases made by each age group. The 20-24 year olds made 365 purchases in total and the 40+ year old people only made 13 purchases. From this data, I then looked at the top spenders with Lisosia93 making the most purchases with 5, spending $18.96. I then dove deeper into the most popular items sold and Final Critic made the top of that list, being bought 13 times. This item was also the most profitable, resulting in $59.99 spent on it in total.
